<p>I'm first and foremost a screenwriter, however I also have experience in editing.  
My love for film started from a very young age and is manifested by my large collection of VHS tapes. 
I graduated from Sacramento City College, with an Associates of Arts and from Cal State Los Angeles with a Bachelor of
 Arts in 2020. I am now currently in a program to get a MLIS at San Jose State University.</p>
