<p>The videos used on this website were edited by me. The videos, for example, my sound design clip, contain
videos and audio owned by other people and companies. The only exception would be the short film I worked on. The music accompaning my reviews are also copyrighted by other
companies. Fair use, such as transformative use allowed me to edit something different out of those videos.</p>

 <h2>Accessibility</h2>

 <p>The default text of Times New Roman was used since it will load on most devices. For the font the color black was used to make sure the links were
eligible. There is a lot of text used in the body of the pages. The color of the font was kept dark since the background of the page was white. Any light
colored font would have made the page hard to read.</p>
