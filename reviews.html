<h3>Review</h3>
	
<p>A lot of my taste in movies probably, now that I think about it, 
	came from my brother, who is only a couple of years older than me. 
	I remember watching some weird movies that he brought over. There are 
	two I remember the most. One is Harold and Maude and the other is Rock n 
	Roll High School. Mostly because of the explosive (pun intended) ending and the Ramones.</p>
	
	<p>I had the song and the title of the movie etched in my head for years, until a 
	couple of years ago, I found that Shout Factory! had released the film on Blu Ray. I had to have it. 
	I did get it and watched it. And oh my god is it fantastic.</p>
	
	<p>What this film does really well is portray the whole punk ideal in every single part of its production. 
	The fast pace of it, the characters, the music, the jokes, everything! (Well some of the jokes didn’t hold up) 
	It also captures teenage rebellion against an oppressive, borderline fascist school principal, really well.</p>
	
	<p>The humor switches from simple jokes to flat out parody. This movie has some of my favorite running gags, the 
	mouse student is one of them. The freshman that's always being hazed. The supposedly hot and suave varsity football guy 
	sucks at talking to women and is forced to hire some sleazy guy to even get a date. The cameos by the Germs, Don Steele, 
	and Dick Miller make it all the better. If you have not seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and experience it for yourself 
	as soon as you can.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>
	
	<p>I remember that in high school, an English teacher told the class that if you were making a lot of mistakes on an 
	essay, that means you were learning, that you were trying something different. To me, that is The Black Cauldron. This 
	film marks a lot of "firsts" for Disney, if the IMDB trivia section is to be believed. First of their movies not to have 
	any singing, first of their movies to use CGI, first to receive a PG rating. So of course, they aren't going to be completely
	successful in pulling it off, so I understand how people don't like it.</p>
	
	<p>It's kind of messy and the scenes that were cut don't help. 
	I, however, adore this movie. The animation is great and the design of the Horned King is scary. It was ballsy of Disney to adapt
	the 2nd book in a series into a single film. What makes me love it, even more, is that it's a remnant of a time when Disney actually 
	took risks and did not do the same easy, safe, commercial stuff as they have for the last decade.</p>
	
	<p>The VHS case says it's part of the Disney Masterpiece collection and I couldn't agree more.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>
	
	<p>Every year there's one movie that never lived up to the hype. Fortunately, this is just a good as everyone says it. 
	Greta Gerwig fills Barbie with such a unique vision and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling bring so much energy to something
	that would have remained as lifeless as the toy behind the movie if anyone else played them. The movie itself wasn't just 
	about feminism, but self-identity.</p>
	
	<p>Too bad it was caged behind an ad for a toy. I hope dimwitted studio execs (a redundant phrase) 
	don't get the wrong message and see that greenlighting women-led films, directed by women, and a director with a vision is what made 
	this movie successful and not that it was based on a toy.</p>
	
	<p>Thought going in that I was going to relate to Ken. Turns out I related to both Barbie and Allan (both asexual?)</p>
